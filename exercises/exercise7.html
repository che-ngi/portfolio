            <a class="button" href="https://devpost.com/software/cam-sjhub4">HackHarvard 2019</a> <br> In 2019, I attended a hackathon(Design sprint-like event, "Hack Marathon") hosted by Harvard University. My team and I created a Web/Mobile App called アニメCam (Anime Cam) that gives you information regarding an anime(Japanese Animation) by taking a photo or screenshot. It would give information such as the name of the anime, the episode, the time stamp, as well as other fun facts about the anime. We used a Python Flask server in the back end which has an endpoint which takes the parameter of an image link. There is a web page which was built with HTML and CSS from scratch which touches our endpoint. The application itself was made using React Native and Expo. The anime search functionality uses the API Trace.moe. The image uploading is done through converting the binary to base64 and then pushing to Imgur using the Imgur API.

            <a class="button" href="http://hackumass-viii-projects.hackumass.com/61.html">HackUMass VIII<br></a> Early 2020, my friends and I decided to join a Hackathon hosted by UMass Amherst for fun. We created a very simple meme/caption maker where you can input a picture and a caption and it would display it. For our tech stack we used a Python Flask server, HTML/CSS, and Bootstrap as a toolkit.

            <a class="button" href="https://www.instagram.com/che.ngi/">Photography Portfolio</a> <br> This photography portfolio showcases one of my personal hobbies. From Boston to South Dakota to Paris to Japan, I proudly present some of my favorite shots that I have taken throughout my travels. I plan to study abroad in Seoul, Korea in the fall and will be sharing my experiences, adding onto the portfolio I have.

            <a class="button" href="https://cyxiong.com/intro-to-ux-research-spring-2022-project/">UX Research Experiment</a><br> In my UX Research Class, we will be creating a research experiment comparing the user experience between two products, a notebook and an IPad, for taking notes. We will be recruiting participants to participate through surveying and interviewing, collecting data, visualizing data, and presenting our findings.
